		Abstract:- A supply chain consists of many stakeholders such as suppliers, carriers and customers. It is
often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure
in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain
technology can solve this problem by having only a ``one trusted ledger'' that could reshape the element of
data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information
sharing within a supply chain.</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level
of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic
literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled
information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such
as health and medical, construction and smart city. From our ndings, one potential impact of deploying
blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain is that it ensures all members in the chain
can obtain veried information which enhances collaborative partnerships. Through this in-depth research,
we highlighted potential barriers that could impede the development of blockchain technology in supply
chain such as the lack of understanding of blockchain technology in businesses and conict of interests.
Futurework such as information hiding, in parallel with information sharing, could close the gap in deploying
this technology within a supply chain.</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Understanding the nature of different supply chain is also important
to better prepare the deployment of blockchain. We acknowledge that our approach in selecting literatures
in our systematic review may exclude certain literatures. Nonetheless, we tried to include as many relevant
literatures as possible, to develop a roadmap on the current situation of blockchain-enabled information
sharing within a supply chain.
